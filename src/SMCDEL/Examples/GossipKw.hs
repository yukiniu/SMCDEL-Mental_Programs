__Knowing-whether Gossip on belief structures with epistemic change__

We consider the classic telephone problem where \(n\) agents each know only their
own secret in the beginning and then make phone calls in which they always
exchange all secrets they know.
For now we only consider static and not dynamic gossip, i.e.\ all agents can
call all others --- the \(N\) relation is total.

In this section we follow the following article and use /knowing-whether/:
Agent \(a\) knows the secret of \(b\) iff \(K_a^? p_b\).

We use belief instead of knowledge structures because this makes it much
easier to describe the event observation law.
Otherwise we would have to add a lot more observational variables.

Still, the relations actually will be equivalences — despite the name, nobody
is being deceived in the classic gossip problem as we model it here. Hence not
using knowledge structures optimized for S5 is a big waste.

In "SMCDEL.Examples.GossipS5" we present an alternative model which is an
abstraction of the one here and performs better, but has other limitations.

The following is an ad-hoc solution to calculate `secSetT` in advance.
A more efficient implementation should use multi-pointed transformers.
